# Gene: Genetic Engineering Biology Note ðŸ§¬
An interactive expereince that features biology knowledge. The characters are completed hand drawn by me, so are the other pixel arts/animations. (Except for the Minecraft cursors, they're from Google)

## How to Play
Click to interact with stuff, almost everything could be interacted with. There are many characters and mini stories in my website.

Navigate the website by clicking the 'Next' button, which would lead to the next scene. Each scene will bring out a biology knowledge about genetic engineering. (Psst, click the '!' for extra notes) <br><br>
